# Welcome

<div class="important">

Welcome to the Melbourne Haskell Workshop 2013.

This intent of this workshop is to provide a working introduction to Haskell
for programmers in Melbourne who have not yet used the language in anger.

The workshop is split into chapters - each lasting an hour. Chapters will start
with a few trivial introductory exercises to get your fingers warmed up,
then the meat - an exercise that should be able to be solved using the material
introduced up to that point (with help and hints available if needed).

Each chapter will conclude with an open-question. This question should provide
inspiration for further consideration of how harder problems could
be solved using Haskell, and for more advanced attendees, can be attacked
instead of twiddling your thumbs after finishing the main exercise.

## Why run a free haskell workshop?

There are a few kinds of benefits that we anticipate will result as an
outcome of the workshop:

* Benefits to Individuals
* Benefits to the Community
* Benefits to the Volunteers
* Benefits to the Organisers
* Benefits to Industry
* Benefits to Relationships

### Benefits to Individuals

* New Tools
* Experience writing Haskell
* An Introduction to the Wider Community

What do we hope that an individual attendee will gain by coming to the workshop?

Since this workshop is targeted towards beginners, we want an attendee
to come away from the workshop with new tools at their disposal. Yes,
a new language to reimplement existing knowledge with various platform
benefits, but more importantly, a new tool for dissecting problems.

Learning a new problem-solving approach will almost certainly
be the most challenging part of the workshop, but through
the consistent delivery of exercises that benefit from domain
modelling, we hope that the attendee will walk away with the
confidence to attack new problems from the "Haskell Mindset".

Although there won't be time to work on any large-scale problems,
we hope that the approaches we demonstrate will be able to
be applied with confidence to problems of any size.

Aside from the technical benefits, the workshop should provide a great
opportunity for attendees to meet many other members of the
Melbourne Haskell using community.

### Benefits to the Community

* Haskell as a Tool for Communication
* Local Network Effects
* Consolidation

Often, Haskell (especially the type-system) can be an extremely effective means
of communication of certain kinds of behaviors, requirements, and problems.
If this workshop can help advance Haskell as a common language for
inter-personal discussion of technical topics, then the barriers of communication
will be lowered and the community as a whole should become more productive.

Often, it isn't until a particular community reaches a critical mass
that it comes into its own. Currently the Melbourne Haskell community
is reasonably disparate and unconnected (especially outside of MFUG).
If the various groups of people using Haskell can be consolidated,
then we would consider starting a regular Melbourne Haskell meetup.
Just having the ability to ask questions in person can go a long
way to advancing confidence in a particular topic, therefore,
as the number of Haskell users increases locally, so to will
the overall skill of individuals and the community as a whole.

### Benefits to the Volunteers

* Experience
* Networking

We hope that for the volunteers, providing administrative
and in-person assistance will be a rewarding experience.
We are very open to people of any skill level helping out
and this could be a great opportunity for newcomers to the
community to get their fingers dirty by providing assistance
at the workshop.

The workshop should also be a good networking opportunity for
volunteers, as a stratified group of Haskellers of this size has not yet
convened in Melbourne.

### Benefits to Industry

It has been said that once you are comfortable programming Haskell, you
become spoiled, and won't want to go back to your previous languages.
Rather than quit your day-job, if Haskell's presence can be advanced in
industry, then the Joy of programming haskell will become a possibility
in your day-to-day work-life. A longer-term goal to be sure.

This benefit may be the most tenuous outcome of the workshop, but as
the mindshare of Haskell grows, the chances of it being
used for projects within industry increases.

* An understanding of the language's strengths
	and weaknesses emerges empowers decision makers to weigh up if the language is
	a suitable candidate to solve the technical problems at hand.
* Confidence is gained that there are enough people using the language
  that hiring a programmer will not be a problem if this is required.

The technical benefits to industry will have the most impact
where a rigorous solution to a problem is necessary. In the financial
sector, Haskell is beginning to become more popular as the cost
of bugs can be very high. Technical benefits, however, are a moot point
if Haskell does not see adoption.

If this workshop can give project-leaders in industry, making programming-language choices,
the confidence to consider Haskell as a real candidate, then it will have
gone a long way towards making Melbourne a more attractive place
to be for people who wish to use Haskell in day-to-day work.

### Benefits to the Organisers

Last-but-not-least -

<div class="important">

For us, the organisers, running this workshop will
be a great opportunity to see the Melbourne Haskell community in
action. We're looking forward to working with you all and expect that,
above all else, we will have a lot of...

## _Fun!_
